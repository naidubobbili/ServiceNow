Perform tests in parallel

Individual tests initiated manually are run in parallel. 
However, tests that are scheduled or run within a test suite do not run in parallel. 
They run one after another sequentially. 
Running individual tests in parallel can save time for Test Designers creating and 
debugging different tests simultaneously. 

In order for tests to run in parallel safely, they must be run at least once. 
This detects and stores a list of all records modified by the test. 
The list is used by ATF to prevent other tests modifying the same records from running at the same time. 
The list of records modified by each test is regenerated after every run.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Note

Running ATF tests in parallel is NOT possible using a ServiceNow Developer Portal personal instance 
due to predefined instance configurations that cannot be adjusted. 

Other typical ServiceNow customer instances are able to run ATF tests in parallel. 
If you are not able to run ATF tests in parallel on your customer instance, 
your system administrator should contact ServiceNow customer support to review the instance configuration.

Monitor test runs

"Automated Test Framework > Run > Waiting/Running Test Runs"

Cancel pending tests

To cancel the waiting test from the list, let select its check box and deletes it using Actions on selected rows.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Know the rollback

When a test completes, the instance changes it makes are rolled back. 
This includes any new records being deleted and deleted records being restored. 
However, the rollback is not actually a true instance rollback. 
Instead, it works by tracking updates made by the impersonated user of the test. 
When the test completes, those user changes rollback.
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Tables excluded from rollback by ServiceNow

Any records modified in the following tables are excluded from the rollback following a test run.
Emails and reports are typically excluded, so their content and styling can be checked manually.

History [sys_history_line]
ECC Queue [ecc_queue]
Email [sys_email]
Email Log [sys_email_log]
Report Execution [report_executions]
Report Stats [report_stats]
or any table extending these tables
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Tables excluded from rollback by you

Additional tables can be excluded from the rollback after a test run by adding an "excludedFromRollback=true Attribute" 
to their Collection record in "System Definition > Dictionary".
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Asynchronous data changes

Some asynchronous changes are not always finished in time to be included within the rollback following a test run. 
This would include things like event processing, email notifications, and workflow updates.
Do not rely on the rollback of asynchronous changes to complete before the next test is run.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Run on client or server

Some test steps must be performed on the client user interface. 
These test steps simulate user interactions, such as opening a form. 
Other test steps must be performed on the server against the instance. 
These include impersonating users, submitting or saving records, running server-side script, or making REST calls.

If a test includes test steps performed on the client user interface, 
when the test is run ATF opens a client test runner within a separate browser window to execute the actions. 
Client test runners can be run across different browsers to facilitate compatibility testing. 
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Tip

If you need to make instance updates while tests are running, 
there is a way to keep the two from impacting each other in the same browser session.
Just use a different browser application to perform the updates, such as Firefox if tests are running in Chrome. 
Another option is to make the updates using the "incognito" feature of many browsers. 
Open the Chrome browser menu, then select New Incognito Window.

When viewing the list of waiting and running test suites, 
keep in mind multiple test suites can run at the same time.
However, the tests included in any of the test suites still only run one at a time.
Therefore, if a parent test suite is run, its child test suites also appear in the list as running. 
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Sometimes when trying to run a test or test suite, 
is surprised to see the Run Test or Run Test Suite button does not appear. 
It happens even when if knows ATF has been enabled on the instance.
Then look in the upper-right of the ServiceNow banner and sees what is wrong. 
Tests and test suites cannot be run while manually impersonating another user.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

"After a failed test suite run, there might be some test adjustments to make. 
Once you complete the changes, rather than run the entire test suite again, 
just open its test suite results and select Re-run Failed Tests. 
Only the tests that were not included in the last run will execute.
It can save a lot of time, especially if the tests simulate user interface actions."
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

ATF tests can be run in two different ways: Run test or Debug test. Run test runs the test as normal.
Debug test pauses the test at each breakpoint. Breakpoints can be inserted in a test to indicate 
where the test should pause before continuing. This pause provides an opportunity to examine the test in progress 
and troubleshoot why it is failing. A breakpoint can be added at any test step along the way.
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Run Test will ignore breakpoints 

Once a broken test is fixed, it is not necessary to remove the breakpoints. 
Using Run test will ignore all breakpoints and run the test normally.

However, if you would like to remove a breakpoint, right click on the step that has the breakpoint 
and select Add/Remove Breakpoint. The breakpoint will be removed.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Once debugged test, Donâ€™t have to worry about removing all of the breakpoints. 
simply use Run test instead of Debug test. That way, the test ignores all breakpoints and runs normally.
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Change the pause duration

The test will remain paused for 10 minutes by default and then automatically continue with the rollback.
The duration of the rollback pause can be overwritten using: sn_atf.breakpoint.timeout. 
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Debug test additional points

-->All test types are supported, including individual tests, test suites, and parameterized tests.
   All step types are also supported by this feature, including server-side and client UI.

-->Breakpoints are not shared. They are tied to each specific user. 
   If two users are debugging the same test, each user has their own set of breakpoints.
   The users will not affect or interfere with each other as they place breakpoints or run their test in Debug test mode.

-->Scheduled tests will always run in Run test mode, not Debug test mode.

-->The Debug test feature is available out-of-the-box beginning with the San Diego release.
   No special configurations are required.
   Users include: atf_test_admin and atf_test_designer.

-->The test will pause for 10 minutes before continuing with the rollback. 
   The duration of the rollback pause can be overwritten using: sn_atf.breakpoint.timeout.

Test runner vs. cloud runner

When running a test using Test Runner, the client browser window needs to remain open and visible while the test is running.
This is because the test is running locally on your system. That means someone has to be present to monitor the test, 
keep the browser window open, and make sure the machine does not fall asleep. 
This does not allow you to work on something else on that machine while the test is running. But...

Beginning in Tokyo, there is a new option for running tests: Cloud Runner.

Discovere the ServiceNow Store app called: ATF Test Generator and Cloud Runner. When tests are run using Cloud Runner,
they run in ServiceNow's cloud server infrastructure instead of local machine. This frees up to work on other things 
while the tests are running!
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Parallel tests

Cloud Runner has two free parallel test executions. This means, if it has a test suite that contains 50 tests,
two of the 50 tests would run at the same time. Once those 2 tests are finished, two more would run, and so on.  

If more parallel tests are desired, customers can choose to pay for up to 7 concurrent tests for even faster results.
