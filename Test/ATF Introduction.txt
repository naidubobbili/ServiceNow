ATF Introduction
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Functional business logic testing

ATF was designed to target functional business logic testing. 
It verifies a process is fit for its intended purpose and meets its defined acceptance criteria. 
ATF can provide functional testing across the Now Platform. 
It supports delivered applications, all scoped applications, Service Portal, custom tables, and custom forms. 
Testing can be performed on the user interface or directly against instance data on the server.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Regression testing

ATF is great for regression testing. 
Create comprehensive testing plans to ensure existing processes still work as expected following an upgrade or 
development cycle. Run the same comprehensive testing plan before and after major changes to get a baseline. 
ATF provides assurance that the same tests will run in the same manner, allowing routine instance checks to be 
performed whenever necessary.

Browser compatibility testing

ATF also targets compatibility testing across multiple browsers and operating systems. 
Write an ATF test once, and then verify the same functionality works as expected for all supported environments.

Server-side Jasmine testing

ATF can be integrated with Jasmine, an open source testing framework for JavaScript. 
Jasmine tests are called to verify server-side functionality from the steps of an ATF test.

ATF is not designed to cover User Acceptance Testing (UAT) for sign-off approval

Test Designer

The Test Designer is the most common ATF role on a ServiceNow project. 
Any team member assigned the Test Designer role can create and run tests and test suites. 
Most application developers are assigned the role since ATF tests should be created for all important customizations. 

Although coding skills are not mandatory, debugging tests takes an advanced level of ServiceNow and ATF knowledge.

Test Designers can perform the following capabilities:

Create, edit, and delete tests suites
Create, edit, and delete tests
Add test steps to tests using existing test step configurations (new test step configurations can only be created by a Test Administrator)
Run tests and test suites
View test results
View ATF system properties

Coding skills required: Low-code or No-code

Test Administrator

Test Administrators ensure ATF system properties are set appropriately to control how the ATF environment operates within an instance.
Administrators also define retention policies to determine how long testing results should be kept.

A large percentage of the time required by Test Administrators involves creating new test step configurations.
Once created, test step configurations can be reused by any ATF role. 
The more new test step configurations required by the project, the more impact there will be on the Test Administrator. 

Since new test step configurations are created using script, Test Administrators should have advanced coding experience.
Due to their experience, they are often pulled in to help Test Designers debug failing tests or create new ones.

Test Administrators can perform all the capabilities of a Test Designer, plus the following:

Edit ATF system properties
Create test step configurations

Coding skills required: Pro-code

Web Service Testers

Web Service Testers build web service tests. The role provides access to the web service modules required to facilitate test development. 
Typically, web service tests make use of REST integration. However, technologies like SOAP can be used through scripting. 
The number of Web Service Testers required is dependent on the amount of web service integration customization implemented. 

Since web service integrations might require the use of script, Web Service Testers should have advanced coding experience. 
Due to their experience, they are often pulled in to help Test Designers debug failing tests or create new ones.

Web Service Testers can perform all the capabilities of a Test Designer, plus the following:

Steps

1. Identify essential functionality per process / application
2. Create tests to validate essential functions
3. Package Tests into Suites
4. Run or Schedule test execution
5. Monitor and fix issues
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

The ATF framework is not meant to run in ServiceNow production instance environments. 
ATF tests and test suites should only be run in non-production instances. 
Verifying production instances typically involves User Acceptance Testing (UAT) performed by stakeholders. 

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

The ATF system property to enable tests and test suites to run is defaulted off for all ServiceNow instances.

some of the important reasons ATF is prevented from running on their production instance include:

1.Running ATF tests slows down instance performance.

2.Changes made within an ATF test would be visible to users before the rollback.

3.Actionable events, such as email notifications to customers or approvals to managers, would be triggered from data changed by ATF tests.

4.Sensitive production data could be seen when impersonating a user.

5.Audit history of data changes would remain even after data rollback.

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Although ATF is not run in a production environment, ATF development objects are still promoted into the production instance. 
This ensures they will be included when the production instance is cloned down to the development or test instances.

Test
A set of ordered actions or assertions, whose changes rollback after a run

Test step
A single action or assertion with configured input values

Test suite
A set of tests and test suites that can be scheduled or run on-demand

Test step configuration
Definition of the behavior and characteristics for a type of action or assertion

Client test runner
Simulates UI actions or assertions within a separate browser window when a test is run

Accelerate development with quick start tests

quick start tests:

1.Represent a small set of critical use cases
 
2.Install easily with the demo data of a ServiceNow application

3.Can be used as templates to build and customize test and test suites matching your unique processes

4.Run against your instance specific data once copied and configured

5.Annotate your copy of the test if ServiceNow ever changes the original
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

quick start tests are inactive, read-only templates. 
They only produce a pass result when run with the demo data provided by their corresponding ServiceNow plugin. 
To allow quick start tests to run successfully against your instance data, you must first create a copy of the quick start test. 
Once the quick start test is copied, you can apply any desired changes and run the test.
